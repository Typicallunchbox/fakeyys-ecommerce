## Summary

Fakeyys is a portfolio project which was built to further improve the author's skills. This project can be thought of as a guide to a developer interested in building a React site which makes use of framer-motion for a better user experience. This project is only front facing and does not contain any backend components, it is purely frontend focused. The project structure was created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a powerful frontend project generation tool.

* Main Frontend dependencies:
    * [React](https://react.dev/)
    * [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
    * [React router dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
    * [React-three/fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
    * [React-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
    * [Three](https://threejs.org/)
 



 
## Getting Started
If you are interested in getting started on your own personal project structured like this one I would recommend the Youtube channel [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia), he has a 5 part series on the MERN Stack which was used as guidance on this project. Also below I have done a breakdown of explaining the [project journey](#project-journey-explained) from backend to frontend.

### Requirments
 * [Github Account](https://github.com/)
 * [MongoDB Account](https://www.mongodb.com/home)
 * [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * [VSCode Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended)

Setting up <b>MongoDb Account</b> has a few extra steps and I recommend watching this time tagged [Youtube video from Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/-0exw-9YJBo?t=2205) to get correctly setup. A reminder to also create your own .env file in your project in order to connect to mongoDB. Below is an example of the .env file structure needed for this project :

Once setup with all the necessary accounts, now we can clone the repository.

[How to Clone a Github Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

Once cloned you will need to run `npm install` command in your terminal in both the root project folder and the frontend folder as there are two seperate node modules on this project.
Finally, your last step is to run `npm run dev` from the root of the project. This will run both the backend api service as well as the frontend at the same time. Enjoy :)
